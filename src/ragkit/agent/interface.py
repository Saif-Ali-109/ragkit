        trace: The full :class:`LoopTraceStep` trace (gate, search, judge,
            answer / refuse) for inspectability.
        refused: ``True`` when the budget was exhausted and the agent could

        direct: ``True`` when the gate decided the fast path — the loop was
            never entered and output is identical to a Phase 1 ``ask()``.

        This type carries only data.  Stream discipline (answers on stdout,
        logs on stderr) is the caller's responsibility — the agent never
