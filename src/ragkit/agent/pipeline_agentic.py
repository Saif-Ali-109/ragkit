"""Agentic vs. direct orchestration entry point (SPEC §4, PLAN §3.2).

:func:`agentic_ask` is the phase-2 orchestrator and the CLI / tests entry
point. It applies the strategy (`auto|direct|agentic`), then either:

    * **direct** (or ``auto``-with-simple-gate) — the Phase-1 fast path.  With
      injected components it runs the framework's direct core natively;
      otherwise it delegates to the host application's ``ask()`` wiring
      (registered via :func:`ragkit.agent.host_wiring.set_host_wiring`), so the
      app's output stays byte-identical to a Phase 1 ``ask()``
      (``direct=True``, gate-only trace).
    * **agentic** (or ``auto``-with-complex-gate) — runs the compiled LangGraph
      loop over an :class:`AgentLoopState` and converts the final state back
      into an :class:`AgentResult` (full trace, ``direct=False``).

The gate decision is always recorded first in the trace, with one of the
decisions ``"direct"`` / ``"agentic"`` / ``"forced-direct"`` /
``"forced-agentic"``.

        top_k: Retrieval count.  On the direct/fast path defaults to

        language: Retrieval language filter; defaults to

        max_retries: Hard judge budget; defaults to ``config.AGENT_MAX_RETRIES``
