"""Shared direct/fast ask core: retrieve → context+sources → generate → cite.

The Phase-1 ask path exists in two places today —
:func:`docpilot.pipeline_ask.ask` (the CLI pipeline, SPEC §3.7–§3.11) and
:func:`docpilot.api.service._run_direct` (the streamed SSE fast path,
SPEC §7).  Both perform the same retrieval / context construction /
generation / citation work; they differ only in observability: ``ask`` logs
retrieval detail and the reconstructed prompt, while the service emits
step/token SSE events.  This module is that shared core, so the two callers
stay byte-identical without duplicating the logic.

Design notes:

    * The core is **logging-free** — every log line keeps the provenance of
      its caller (the CLI's ``--debug`` stderr stays byte-identical); the
      callers pass hooks for anything they want to observe.
    * Optional ``emit`` hooks let the service drive its event sequence from
      the same code path: ``on_search`` fires immediately after retrieval
      (so the service can emit the debug-panel payload + ``search`` trace
      step before any token arrives) and ``on_generate_delta`` receives each
      streamed answer token.  With no hooks the core performs pure Phase-1
      behaviour — a single ``generate_answer`` call, never streaming —
      exactly what ``pipeline_ask.ask`` needs.
    * Latency is owned by the callers (``ask`` measures from its own start;
      the service measures from before its gate step).  The core only exposes
      the ``time.perf_counter()`` timestamps captured before retrieval and
      before generation so the service can build trace steps whose ``started_at``
      values land in the same places as before.

Import graph: this module depends only on :mod:`ragkit.core.models` and
:mod:`ragkit.generation.prompts`, so both ``pipeline_ask`` and
``api.service`` can import it without cycles.  The placeholder context note
(:data:`_NO_CONTEXT_NOTE`) is defined here but re-exported from
``docpilot.pipeline_ask``, which is where :mod:`docpilot.agent.graph` (and
the tests) import it from.

        answer: The citation-formatted answer string.

        top_k: Number of chunks to retrieve (already resolved by the caller).
        filter_language: Language filter for the retrieval call; ``None``
            means no filtering (already resolved by the caller).
        on_search: Optional hook invoked with ``(results, search_started)``
            immediately after retrieval — before context is built, sources
            derived, or any token is generated.  The service uses it to emit
            the debug-panel payload and ``search`` trace step; the CLI wrapper
            uses it for its retrieval log lines.  ``None`` → no hook.
        on_generate_delta: Optional hook receiving each answer token as it is
            produced.  When given, the core tries ``generate_answer_stream``
            first and falls back to a single ``generate_answer`` when
            streaming is unsupported (``NotImplementedError``) or produced
            nothing usable — the fallback emits the whole response as one
            delta.  When ``None``, the core always uses the single
            ``generate_answer`` call (pure Phase-1 behaviour, never streams).

    Returns:
