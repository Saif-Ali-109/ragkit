"""Corpus maintenance helpers for the ragkit PostgreSQL store.

Provides tools to detect and remove duplicate ``chunks`` rows — the
historical symptom of two overlapping/crashed ingest runs inserting the
same logical chunk twice (identical ``source_file`` + ``heading_path`` +
``chunk_index``). The ``chunks_unique_triple`` unique index (see
``db/schema.sql``) prevents new twins; these helpers clean up legacy ones.

Note on transactions: unlike the vector-store methods (which commit per
operation), :func:`dedupe_chunks` does **not** commit — the caller decides.
This keeps the operation safe to run inside a transaction for tests and
allows the CLI to commit once, then apply the schema/unique index.
