"""Reranker interface + cross-encoder implementation (PLAN §H finding 1).

Pure cosine top-k retrieval orders candidates by embedding similarity alone;
for technical docs dense vectors can underweight exact API names / error
codes that a cross-encoder re-scoring pass picks up.  The pipeline fetches a
wider candidate window from the vector store, runs the ``Reranker`` over it,
and keeps the re-scored ``top_k``.

The implementation uses ``BAAI/bge-reranker-base`` via sentence-transformers
``CrossEncoder`` (already a project dependency — same local-model pattern as
BGE-small embeddings).  Model files are downloaded lazily on first use, so
the live environment needs one-time HuggingFace access per model.
