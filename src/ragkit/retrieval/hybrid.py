"""Hybrid retrieval: dense-vector + lexical fused by score-free rank fusion.

``HybridRetriever`` composes a vector ``Retriever`` (Phase 1 dense path,
optionally reranked) and a ``LexicalSearcher`` (keyword path) and merges
their candidate lists with Reciprocal Rank Fusion — a rank-based merge that
needs no shared score scale, so cosine similarity and ``ts_rank`` fuse
cleanly (PLAN §H finding 2).
