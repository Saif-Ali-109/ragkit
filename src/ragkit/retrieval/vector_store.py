    **Design notes on psycopg 3 + pgvector:**

    We use ``pgvector.psycopg.register_vector(conn)`` (available in
    pgvector ≥ 0.3) to register the vector adapter/injector so that
    ``numpy.ndarray`` objects can be passed directly as query parameters
    for the ``embedding`` column.  For inserts, pgvector's register_vector
    also accepts ``list[float]`` or ``numpy.ndarray`` — so we pass the
    raw ``np.ndarray`` objects directly rather than serializing them to
    text strings.

    **Chunk id vs. schema id:**

    The ``Chunk`` dataclass has a string ``id`` attribute used as a
    deterministic identifier across ingestion runs.  The ``chunks`` table
    uses ``UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`` for its ``id``
    column — the two are *not* the same.  The deterministic chunk id is
    stored in ``metadata`` JSONB under key ``"chunk_id"`` so that
    AGENT E's debug output can reference it.  (See class docstring.)
