"""Hermetic tests for the LangGraph wiring (PLAN §3.6, SPEC §4.5).

All tests use injected fakes — no network, no DB, no live LLM. They exercise
the compiled ``StateGraph`` directly with an ``AgentLoopState`` whose trace
already carries the pipeline's gate step (mirroring what
:func:`ragkit.agent.pipeline_agentic.agentic_ask` feeds the graph).

Covered routing / budget / node-level guarantees:
    * sufficient first pass → answer, exactly 1 judge call;
    * insufficient → reformulate → second search → sufficient;
    * insufficient twice → refuse (≤ AGENT_MAX_RETRIES judge calls);
    * Phase 3: needs_tool → tool_call → answer with live GitHub evidence;
    * Phase 3: tool failure → refuse with a "tool_error" trace step;
    * Phase 3: needs_tool without a wired tool → plain insufficient retry;
    * Phase 3: needs_tool on the last permitted round → refuse, no tool call;
    * Phase 3: the judge is told tools_available True/False;
    * trace latency_ms + turn detail (retrieved count / top scores);
    * a node is invoked with the *injected* component instance (no vendor).

``FakeRetriever``, ``StubJudge`` and ``StubTool`` are shared with the
pipeline tests.
